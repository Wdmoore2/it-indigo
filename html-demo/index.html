<strong>The Buffalo National River Region: A Paddler's and Hiker's Paradise</strong>
<p>The Buffalo National River, established in 1972 as America's first national river, is a spectacular destination. Its towering limestone bluffs, pristine waters, and accessible gravel bars make it a premier spot for multi-day paddling trips and scenic hiking. Many veteran explorers consider the Buffalo a must-do trip, especially during the spring float season. It's often said, "You haven't truly seen Arkansas until you've floated under the towering cliffs of the Buffalo."</p>
